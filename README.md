# XCOM 2 Community Translation Mod

This is a community project for gathering all translations for other XCOM 2 mods in one place. Anyone can submit their translation for any existing mod, and it will be added to the Community Translation Mod.

## I am a mod user, how do I use this?

Subscribe to the mod on the **[Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3000755533)**, wait for Steam to download the mod, then activate it in your mod launcher.

If you are using a non-Steam version of the game, download the **[latest release](https://github.com/Iridar/X2CommunityTranslation/releases/latest)** and follow **[these instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/xcom2mods/wiki/index/download_mods#wiki_how_to_install_mods_manually)** to install it manually.
